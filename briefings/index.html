        <h3>Story of the Day: July 1, 2021</h3>
        <h4>House passes transportation and water infrastructure bill containing $700 billion in new funding</h4>
        <p><b>The House of Representatives</b> on Thursday passed its own infrastructure measure, containing over $700 billion for new projects focused on the environment and conservation. It provides over $300 billion in funding for roads, bridges, and safety, over $200 billion for public transit, and over $150 billion for water programs including drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Two Republicans voted with all Democrats to pass the bill, which was written by Democrats. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Or.) said that the bipartisan plan crafted by President Biden and a group of centrist senators was very close to the House bill, and that there was potential for an agreement.</p>
        <p>But most Republicans criticized the bill for being too climate-focused, believing that a transportation and infrastructure bill should not include, for example, funding for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in transportation and boosting electric vehicles.</p>
        <p>Rep. DeFazio hopes that senators involved in crafting a partisan budget reconciliation bill with provisions for climate change, health care, and child care would use the House-passed bill as a framework.</p>
        <p>The bill will likely fail in the Senate because of a lack of Republican support.</p>

      <h3>Briefing: June 30, 2021 17:30 UTC</h3>
      <h4>Biden makes fragile infrastructure deal with G20 senators</h4>
      <p>President Biden this week endorsed a <b>bipartisan infrastructure investment plan</b> with support from 20 key centrist senators from both sides of the aisle. This group of senators, known as the Group of 20 (G20), is comprised of ten members of the Democratic caucus and ten members of the Republican caucus.</p>
      <p>The deal would set aside $1.2 trillion over eight years for various "traditional infrastructure" projects, like building bridges, paving roads, and improving public transit, as well as several "green" projects, like installing hundreds of thousands of electric-car charging stations along the nation's interstates.</p>
      <p>The deal was imperiled just one day after it was struck by the senators and the President, due to Biden's comments in a press conference. He threatened to veto the bill if it came to his desk alone, unaccompanied by another bill he favors. The other bill, which congressional Democrats are currently crafting, would contain several trillion more dollars in funding for projects like improving child care, combating climate change, and strengthening the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature achievement.</p>
      <p>The other bill, which Republicans and some centrist Democrats do not favor, would be passed by a parliamentary method called budget reconciliation. This process allows a bill allocating funds to pass without meeting the sixty-vote threshold normally required for legislation in the Senate.</p>
      <p>When Biden made these off-the-cuff comments, several Republican senators threatened to abandon the bipartisan "traditional infrastructure" deal altogether. Though he walked back his statement two days afterward, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still says the House will not move on the bill if it is sent to her chamber without the other, more expansive bill.</p>
      <p>Bipartisanship is hard to come by in today's Washington, and any kind of major legislative agreement between the two parties is a big deal. Though the compromise hangs by a thread in the Senate, it will be a major accomplishment for the President and the Congress that may have a significant impact on the midterm elections looming next year.</p>
      <h4>Supreme Court rules on ACA, religious rights, free speech</h4>
      <p>The United States Supreme Court made <b>several substantial rulings</b> in the past week as the end of the term approaches on July 1. These cases concerned issues from healthcare to free speech and none of the outcomes were exceptionally surprising.</p>
      <p>In <i>Texas v. California</i>, the court ruled, 7-2, that the state of Texas did not have legal standing to challenge the Affordable Care Act's provisions in the Court. In this ruling, the Act, also known as Obamacare, survived its third test in the Supreme Court. Following the ruling, many pundits and politicians declared the effort to end the landmark law that provides health insurance to tens of millions of Americans "over."</p>
      <p>In <i>Fulton v. City of Philadelphia</i>, the Justices ruled, 9-0, that Philadelphia had no right to prevent Catholic Social Services (CSS), a religious-backed foster care agency that the city denied a contract because it denied services to married same-sex couples. The court's opinion said that the City's stance violated the Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>
      <p>In <i>Mahanoy Area School District v. Levy</i>, the Justices decided, 8-1, that students had the right to free speech outside of school. This adds to the 1969 decision in <i>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School</i>, where the court ruled that schools could not stop student speech unless it came in the way of school operations and the students' education.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court, despite its new 6-3 conservative majority, is not a "partisan" institution. In these cases, it delivered wins for liberals (<i>Texas v. California</i>), conservatives (<i>Fulton v. Philadelphia</i>), and free speech (<i>Mahanoy v. Levy</i>). It has proven itself to adhere to legal principles instead of politics. Expect it to continue to do so in the future.</p>
      <p>One major case still waits for a decision by the Court, <i>Brnovich v. DNC</i>, which concerns two election laws in Arizona that the DNC has challenged as violating the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court overturned part of the VRA in 2013, and some advocates are afraid it might issue a sweeping decision and once again weaken the provisions contained in that legislation.</p>
      <h4>Voting rights fight appears dead in U.S. Congress</h4>
      <p>The <b>For the People Act</b>, Democrats' election reform and ethics legislation, failed to overcome a Republican filibuster in the U.S. Senate and was halted before debate. Several Democrats have called this the most important piece of legislation they could pass. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says that "failure is not an option" when it comes to voting-rights legislation being passed in the current Congress.</p>
      <p>After an election plagued by false allegations of voter fraud and conspiracy by former President Donald J. Trump, Republicans in state governments have been eager to move to enact laws to "improve election security and integrity." These laws have appeared in over 40 states and have been enacted in places like Georgia, Arizona, Montana, Iowa, Florida, and Texas. Democrats decry these laws as voter suppression methods to reduce turnout of Black, brown, and young voters (all of whom tend to vote Democratic), and the For the People Act was their federal response.</p>
      <p>However, with the refusal of two key Democratic senators to move to "weaken or remove" the Senate's legislative filibuster, and Republican senators standing firm against the FTPA (along with most other voting-rights reforms, including a compromise bill floated by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) that would include several Republican priorities), it appears at this point that the fight for voting rights legislation has ended in this Congress.</p>

        <h3>Story of the Day: July 5, 2021</h3>
        <h4>Biden's agenda slows down as Congress takes break</h4>
        <p><b>President Biden and Congressional Democrats</b> are slowing down their agendas as the "bipartisan infrastructure framework" deal struck by the President threatens to appeal to no one. Biden's $5 trillion spending proposals are hitting a brick wall in the Senate, where Republicans look ready to oppose nearly everything that comes to a vote.</p>
        <p>Congress is on a break for Independence Day, and Democrats are still working on the $1.2 trillion agreement between the President and Senate centrists. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she will not bring that bill to a vote in the chamber unless it comes accompanied by another, $4 trillion plus 'budget reconciliation' package.</p>
        <p>That all-Democrats package would feature provisions to combat climate change, provide affordable health care, shore up child care, and invest in 'human infrastructure.' Centrist Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin, however, are unlikely to support such a large package.</p>
        <p>Since it's unlikely that either bill will pass without the other, Democrats must deliberate amongst themselves to compromise on each package, with the progressive wing going down and the centrist wing moving up.</p>
        <p>Politically, Democrats tend to be supported by voters that demand results, and $5 trillion in funding is certainly a way to deliver them. But since much of this funding wouldn't be immediate (like the American Rescue Plan's $1,400 checks), there's no guarantee that passing this legislation would have a significant impact on the midterm elections.</p>
        <p>Somewhere, the dam has to break for Democrats, or President Biden's agenda may be toast.</p>

        <h3>Story of the Day: July 4, 2021</h3>
        <h4>Gerrymandering and counter-gerrymandering kick into high gear as 2022 midterm elections approach</h4>
        <p><b>Democrats in Maryland, New York, and elsewhere</b> are ramping up their efforts to maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives and to counter a practice they have decried countless times.</p>
        <p>Gerrymandering, the process of redrawing Congressional district lines to benefit one party or the other, has occurred for centuries. But as elections become closer and politics more divisive, the practice has become an issue with national ramifications. Judges have struck down gerrymandered districts countless times - in North Carolina, Texas, Michigan, and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>For years, Democrats have criticized the practice and have held up a frontage of purity when it comes to the issue. But as Republicans step up their efforts in the states they control (a majority), like states in the Deep South and the Midwest, Democrats are searching for a response. They have increasingly placed 'independent redistricting commissions' in charge of drawing Congressional district lines through state-level legislation.</p>
        <p>This means that liberals have even less room to look than all of the states they control. In only a few states, where Democratic state delegates have the power to redraw the lines, is it possible to anti-gerrymander and balance the scales.</p>
        <p>In Maryland, there is increasing pressure on the legislature to redraw the district lines to cut out Rep. Andy Harris, the only remaining Congressional Republican from that state. It is possible to draw the lines in overwhelmingly-Democratic Maryland to split up the heavy Republican concentration in the state's first district, which Harris represents.</p>
        <p>It would be feasible to draw the boundaries in a way that moves the first district to Biden +15 while keeping every other district Biden +20. This possibility certainly attracts Democrats, who are eager to get rid of Harris. (He has broken with the vast majority of his colleagues on many of his votes, from refusing to condemn QAnon and the Myanmar military coup to voting "no" on renaming a North Carolina post office after Maya Angelou.)</p>
        <p>Democrats also have major sway over the redistricting in New York, where they could target up to five Republican seats; Illinois; and New Mexico.</p>
        <p>It's safe to say that the gerrymandering wars are just getting started, and without some kind of major election and ethics reforms, they're nowhere close to being over. Whoever's ahead in 2022 will likely win the majority in the House of Representatives, with massive ramifications for the 2024 presidential election and beyond.</p>

        <h3>Story of the Day: July 3, 2021</h3>
        <h4>Another ransomware attack on U.S. impacts "thousands" of businesses</h4>
        <p><b>A Russian-based hacking group known as REvil</b>, who carried out the cyberattack on U.S. meatpacking company JBS last month, performed another ransomwear hack on businesses and companies through the information technology and desktop management company Kaseya. Kaseya's software is used by many large IT companies, which in turn have thousands of clients altogether.</p>
        <p>The cybersecurity firm Huntress Labs found that at least twenty such IT groups (known as managed service providers, or MSPs)  were impacted by the hack. Kaseya's network-management software was used to spread the ransomware code.</p>
        <p>When the MSPs were affected by the ransomware campaign, it had a trickle-down effect, causing the hack to affect the clients of the larger MSPs. Huntress Labs says this trickle-down effect has impacted at least a thousand small businesses who have contracted with the affected MSPs.</p>
        <p>The hackers used their code to lock these businesses out of their computer systems, causing some victims, like Coop (a large grocery chain in Sweden), to have to shut down their businesses for a day. The cybercriminals were seeking a $50,000 ransom payment from the smaller companies they impacted and a $5 million payment from larger companies.</p>
        <p>President Biden is under increasing pressure to be tough on the Russian government, who he says are complicit in the massive cyberattacks. When hacking organization DarkSide attacked the Colonial Pipeline, which provides over 40% of the oil supply to the East Coast of the U.S., Biden said the Russian government had "some responsibility" for the attack, even though DarkSide is not directly affiliated with the Kremlin.</p>
        <p>But the Russian government is a known harbor for cybercriminals, and both DarkSide and REvil use software that allows them to avoid targeting potential victims in the Commonwealth of Independent States, which is made up of nine post-Soviet countries, including Russia.</p>
        <p>As ransomware attacks become more common, costly, and critical, the U.S. government should consider boosting the resources to agencies like CISA and the NSA to protect U.S. businesses. Talks with Russia should involve these frequent ransomware attacks, which are in the worst interest of the U.S. government, U.S. companies, and U.S. citizens, as well as free-market democracies all over the globe.</p>

        <h4>Biden declares 'America's back together' as Delta variant spreads</h4>
        <p><b>President Biden and the White House</b> are holding a celebration on July 4 to mark 'independence from [COVID-19].' They say that the worst days of the pandemic are behind us and we should be looking to the future - to a potential infrastructure deal and budget reconciliation spending package, and to life after the pandemic.</p>
        <p>But the Delta coronavirus variant, which was first identified in India late last year, is threatening to put a stop to the festivities. It's on track to become the dominant strain of COVID-19 in the United States, and it has already achieved that in the United Kingdom and India.</p>
        <p>Bolstered by its apparent advantage in transmission, the variant is causing thousands of deaths each day, all over the world, in places with a lower vaccination rate than the United States. But the U.S. hasn't achieved the herd immunity threshold to drive COVID cases to virtually zero. Only 46% of the population is fully vaccinated against the virus, and 55% have received a single dose. (Two-thirds of individuals ages 18 and above have received at least one dose, and 58% of them are fully vaccinated.)</p>
        <p>Fortunately, all three of the vaccines available to Americans are effective against the variant. Pfizer and Moderna say that their vaccines, which use mRNA technology, have the same effectiveness (~95%) against Delta as they do against the original strains of COVID-19. Johnson &amp; Johnson also says its vaccine does not lose any effectiveness (~70%) against the variant.</p>
        <p>The fact remains that new cases are remaining steady at over twelve thousand per day, and President Biden's celebration seems a bit premature. The White House, FDA, CDC, and Congress ought to try to find a way to speed up COVID vaccinations once again, or the pandemic may never end.</p>

        <h3>Story of the Day: July 1, 2021</h3>
        <h4>House passes transportation and water infrastructure bill containing $700 billion in new funding</h4>
        <p><b>The House of Representatives</b> on Thursday passed its own infrastructure measure, containing over $700 billion for new projects focused on the environment and conservation. It provides over $300 billion in funding for roads, bridges, and safety, over $200 billion for public transit, and over $150 billion for water programs including drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Two Republicans voted with all Democrats to pass the bill, which was written by Democrats. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Or.) said that the bipartisan plan crafted by President Biden and a group of centrist senators was very close to the House bill, and that there was potential for an agreement.</p>
        <p>But most Republicans criticized the bill for being too climate-focused, believing that a transportation and infrastructure bill should not include, for example, funding for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in transportation and boosting electric vehicles.</p>
        <p>Rep. DeFazio hopes that senators involved in crafting a partisan budget reconciliation bill with provisions for climate change, health care, and child care would use the House-passed bill as a framework.</p>
        <p>The bill will likely fail in the Senate because of a lack of Republican support.</p>

      <h3>Briefing: June 30, 2021 17:30 UTC</h3>
      <h4>Biden makes fragile infrastructure deal with G20 senators</h4>
      <p>President Biden this week endorsed a <b>bipartisan infrastructure investment plan</b> with support from 20 key centrist senators from both sides of the aisle. This group of senators, known as the Group of 20 (G20), is comprised of ten members of the Democratic caucus and ten members of the Republican caucus.</p>
      <p>The deal would set aside $1.2 trillion over eight years for various "traditional infrastructure" projects, like building bridges, paving roads, and improving public transit, as well as several "green" projects, like installing hundreds of thousands of electric-car charging stations along the nation's interstates.</p>
      <p>The deal was imperiled just one day after it was struck by the senators and the President, due to Biden's comments in a press conference. He threatened to veto the bill if it came to his desk alone, unaccompanied by another bill he favors. The other bill, which congressional Democrats are currently crafting, would contain several trillion more dollars in funding for projects like improving child care, combating climate change, and strengthening the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature achievement.</p>
      <p>The other bill, which Republicans and some centrist Democrats do not favor, would be passed by a parliamentary method called budget reconciliation. This process allows a funding bill to pass without meeting the sixty-vote threshold normally required for legislation in the Senate.</p>
      <p>When Biden made these off-the-cuff comments, several Republican senators threatened to abandon the bipartisan "traditional infrastructure" deal altogether. Though he walked back his statement two days afterward, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still says the House will not move on the bill if it is sent to her chamber without the other, more expansive bill.</p>
      <p>Bipartisanship is hard to come by in today's Washington, and any kind of major legislative agreement between the two parties is a big deal. Though the compromise hangs by a thread in the Senate, it will be a major accomplishment for the President and the Congress that may have a significant impact on the midterm elections looming next year.</p>
      <h4>Supreme Court rules on ACA, religious rights, free speech</h4>
      <p>The United States Supreme Court made <b>several substantial rulings</b> in the past week as the end of the term approaches on July 1. These cases concerned issues from healthcare to free speech and none of the outcomes were exceptionally surprising.</p>
      <p>In <i>Texas v. California</i>, the court ruled, 7-2, that the state of Texas did not have legal standing to challenge the Affordable Care Act's provisions in the Court. In this ruling, the Act, also known as Obamacare, survived its third test in the Supreme Court. Following the ruling, many pundits and politicians declared the effort to end the landmark law that provides health insurance to tens of millions of Americans "over."</p>
      <p>In <i>Fulton v. City of Philadelphia</i>, the Justices ruled, 9-0, that Philadelphia had no right to prevent Catholic Social Services (CSS), a religious-backed foster care agency that the city denied a contract because it denied services to married same-sex couples. The court's opinion said that the City's stance violated the Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>
      <p>In <i>Mahanoy Area School District v. Levy</i>, the Justices decided, 8-1, that students had the right to free speech outside of school. This adds to the 1969 decision in <i>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School</i>, where the court ruled that schools could not stop student speech unless it came in the way of school operations and the students' education.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court, despite its new 6-3 conservative majority, is not a "partisan" institution. In these cases, it delivered wins for liberals (<i>Texas v. California</i>), conservatives (<i>Fulton v. Philadelphia</i>), and free speech (<i>Mahanoy v. Levy</i>). It has proven itself to adhere to legal principles instead of politics. Expect it to continue to do so in the future.</p>
      <p>One major case still waits for a decision by the Court, <i>Brnovich v. DNC</i>, which concerns two election laws in Arizona that the DNC has challenged as violating the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court overturned part of the VRA in 2013, and some advocates are afraid it might issue a sweeping decision and once again weaken the provisions contained in that legislation.</p>
      <h4>Voting rights fight appears dead in U.S. Congress</h4>
      <p>The <b>For the People Act</b>, Democrats' election reform and ethics legislation, failed to overcome a Republican filibuster in the U.S. Senate and was halted before debate. Several Democrats have called this the most important piece of legislation they could pass. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says that "failure is not an option" when it comes to voting-rights legislation being passed in the current Congress.</p>
      <p>After an election plagued by false allegations of voter fraud and conspiracy by former President Donald J. Trump, Republicans in state governments have been eager to move to enact laws to "improve election security and integrity." These laws have appeared in over 40 states and have been enacted in places like Georgia, Arizona, Montana, Iowa, Florida, and Texas. Democrats decry these laws as voter suppression methods to reduce turnout of Black, brown, and young voters (all of whom tend to vote Democratic), and the For the People Act was their federal response.</p>
      <p>However, with the refusal of two key Democratic senators to move to "weaken or remove" the Senate's legislative filibuster, and Republican senators standing firm against the FTPA (along with most other voting-rights reforms, including a compromise bill floated by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) that would include several Republican priorities), it appears at this point that the fight for voting rights legislation has ended in this Congress.</p>

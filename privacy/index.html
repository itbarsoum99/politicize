      <h2 class="mainhead">Privacy policy</h2>
      <p>In short, we do not collect your personal information, nor do we allow external third-parties to do so while you visit our site.</p>
      <h3>Changelog</h3>
      <p>Any changes to the policy are recorded in detail here.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>July 1, 2021: privacy policy is adopted</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Analytics and data collection</h3>
      <p>Politicize does not utilize any data collection tools or website analytics tools like Google Analytics. Your presence on our site is entirely anonymous: we will not even know you visited the site, unless you sign up for newsletter briefings.</p>
      <p>When we collect your email in our sign-up form, it will be used for the sole purpose of sending you the messages you signed up for. We will not save your email for any other purposes, or give your email to anyone else.</p>
      <h3>Advertising</h3>
      <p>Politicize does not have advertising available on its site. Ad trackers and the like are therefore not present here. No external parties have access to your data any more than we do - that is to say, not at all.</p>
      <h3>Third-party data collection</h3>
      <p>We do not use any third parties to do the code insertion, and we do not work with any sites that share personally identifiable information (e.g. name, address, etc.) via their affiliate programs.</p>

      <h3>Our founding</h3>
      <p>Politicize was founded in 2021 as polarization and division in U.S. politics continued to abuse the democratic system of governance. As it became clear that a lack of understanding and confidence in democracy and elections was a root cause of this division, Politicize was founded. The website and e-newsletters provide factual information and news analysis on a weekly basis, explaining democracy in a manner protected by democracy.</p>
      <h3>Our mission</h3>
      <p>The mission of Politicize is to educate, inform, and unify the people by providing factual information about the essential political stories of the week. Politicize believes that this information will help decrease polarization and authoritarian tendencies present in the U.S.' "teetering democracy."</p>
      <h3>Our standards</h3>
      <p>Politicize publishes news analysis, which can sometimes be misinterpreted as opinion. On the contrary, news analysis (at least how we describe it) is a method of interpreting the news cycle and producing some speculation on the near future of relevant legislation and policy matters. In this model, the news is not cast in a negative or positive light; instead, it is interpreted for better understanding and readability.</p>
      <h3>Our format</h3>
      <p>Politicize publishes news briefings each Wednesday with the biggest stories in politics from the week. Every day, we publish one "story of the day," which is an important story that does not make headline news from any of the major outlets.</p>
